# 🌟 To-Do App

A beautiful and functional To-Do application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows you to easily manage your tasks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It also features a progress bar, a completion tracker, and **persistent storage** so your tasks are saved even if you reload the page.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Create Tasks:**
Add new tasks by typing them in and pressing the "+" button.

✅ **Read Tasks:**
View all your added tasks with a clean, elegant UI.

✅ **Update Tasks:**
Edit your tasks anytime using the edit icon.

✅ **Delete Tasks:**
Remove tasks that you no longer need with the delete icon.

✅ **Mark as Completed:**
Mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox — completed tasks get a neat strikethrough to visually differentiate them.

✅ **Progress Bar:**
A progress bar visually shows how many tasks you have completed.

✅ **Persistent Storage:**
Tasks are saved in your browser’s localStorage, so they remain even after refreshing or closing the browser.

✅ **Beautiful UI:**
A calming gradient background with a minimalistic design for an enjoyable user experience.
